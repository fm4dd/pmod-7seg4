This program is demonstrating the function of the 7SEG4 PMOD under VHDL.  It implements a decimal counter 0..9999, displayed on the 4-digit 7-segment display. Counts in 1Hz intervals.

The functionality has been converted from the Verilog program pmod_7seg4_1.v, tested on a Icebreaker v1.0 board, using the Linux open source workflow (yosys, nextpnr, and icestorm). Without an open source VHDL workflow, I am testing VHDL on a DE0-Nano-SoC board with Quartus Prime Version 17.1 Lite Edition on Windows.
